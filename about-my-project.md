## About My Project

Problem: We want to explore the ways we can train AI chatbots to accurately inform users of the trustworthiness of AI. We also want to observe the way chatbots can be used by teachers to help answer their students' questions.

Approach: During this project, I will be working with a team to do the following:

  - Do research on the trustworthiness of artificial intelligence.
  - Train 8 different chatbots to give answers from our research when asked.
  - Test the bots to see how well they work. 

Expected Outcome: The project is expected to have the different chatbots give reliable information on the trustworthiness of AI. We should also have a curriculum that teaches teachers about how to train chatbots.

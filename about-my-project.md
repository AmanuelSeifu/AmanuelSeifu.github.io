## About My Project

Problem: We want to explore the ways we can train AI chatbots to accurately inform users of the trustworthiness of AI.  

Approach: During this project, I will be working with a team to do the following:

  - Do research on the trustworthiness of artificial intelligence.
  - Train 8 different chatbots to give answers from our research when asked.
  - Test the bots to see how well they work. 

Expected Outcome: The project is expected to have the different chatbots give reliable information on the trustworthiness of AI.

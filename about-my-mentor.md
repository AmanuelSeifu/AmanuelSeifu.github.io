## About My Mentor

My mentors this summer are Michael and Keshiyena. Michael is an undergraduate assistant working in Dr. Mack's lab. Keshiyena is a teacher who did their undergrad and masters in biology. Michael is split between several other groups but Kshiyena was assigned only to our group. They have done Chatbot related things before this program.

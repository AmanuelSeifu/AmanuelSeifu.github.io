## What I accomplished:
- I created a cirriculum document power point to show how to use amazon Lex, how to make my chatbot application, and how to use it
- I made a figma mockup of the final website design

## The results I achieved:
- I ended up with an in depth document and powerpoint showcasing info in depth

## The findings I made:
- It's better for our group to focus on making a React chatbot application for teachers

## The algorithms I used:
- I used figma and google slides/docs

## Any issues or frustrations I encountered:
- I had to keep going back to the cirriculum and documentation to add detail

## Any other relevant experiences or insights gained during the week:
- We should change our project goals

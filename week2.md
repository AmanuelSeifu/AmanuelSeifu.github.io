title: Week 2
---

## What I accomplished:
- During the second week, I performed a literature review on three sources that talked about the trustworthiness and human factor of gneerative AI. I used the information to form questions for training chatbots. I also setup the chatbots Chatterbot and Wit.ai.

## The results I achieved:
- I was able to train two chatbots to talk about the trustworthiness of AI.

## The findings I made:
- Chatterbot works the best for generalising speech, but it tends to ask questions as a response at times. Wit.ai was the worst since it required 100% accurate input.

## The algorithms I used:
- I used Chatterbot and Wit.ai.

## Any issues or frustrations I encountered:
- Chatterbot didn't work with google colab and Wit.ai does not output long sentences, only short commands.

## Any other relevant experiences or insights gained during the week:
- Some chatbots are better than others.

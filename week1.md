What I accomplished:
- During the first week, I met with my mentors to discuss the project that
  I will be working on with my group. We also had several lectures covering
  python, numpy, scikit learn, and github in order to better prepare us.

The results I achieved:
- The lectures gave me a refresher on the fundementals of python AI

The findings I made:
- I better understood the project our group will be working on this summer,
  and cleared up any confusion I had.

The algorithms I used:
- N/A

Any issues or frustrations I encountered:
- Everything went smoothly for the most part, but our group is trying to 
  better understand how we can expand our project to last us the whole
  time we're here.

Any other relevant experiences or insights gained during the week:
- I had the opportunity to learn about some of the people in the program.
